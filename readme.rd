Gene : a City
Individual: a route satisfying the conditions
Population : a collection of possible routes (individuals)
Parents: two routes that are combined to create a new route
Mating pool: a collection of parents that are used to create our next population 
Fitness: In this case the fitness is 1/distance_route, we are trying to improve this value
Mutation: a way to introduce variation in our population by randomly swapping two cities in a route
Elitism: a way to carry the best individuals of the current generation into the next generation
